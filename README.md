This is a Repository where I'll be posting the projects that I learn on the way of exploring Android Development. And you try it for yourself as you explore the same path.
#### Alert: Complexity of Apps are in ascending order. 

# Projects
[1 . Currency Converter](https://github.com/Theskyspace/ALP/tree/main/currencyconverter)\
It's a simple converstion of Currency which works only for doller as of now with a funny meme side to it. Can explore to bring smile to your face ðŸ˜‰\
Disapointment alert : If you are experience programmer and don't like memes then not for you.\

[2. Memeotian](https://github.com/Theskyspace/ALP/tree/main/Memeotian)\
